## Examples
```
bt:ISSUE|0|JDOG
This example issues a JDOG token 
```

```
bt:ISSUE|0|JDOG|1||||1|||1
This example issues a JDOG token with MAX_SUPPLY set to 1, Mints 1 token via MINT_SUPPLY, and has LOCK_MAX_SUPPLY set to 1 to permanently lock the MAX_SUPPLY
```

```
bt:ISSUE|0|JDOG|0|0|0|http://j-dog.net/images/JDOG_icon.png
This example issues a JDOG token with a DESCRIPTION which points to an icon
```

```
bt:ISSUE|0|JDOG|0|0|0|http://j-dog.net/images/JDOG_icon.png|0|1JDogZS6tQcSxwfxhv6XKKjcyicYA4Feev
This example issues a JDOG token with a DESCRIPTION which points to an icon, and transfers token ownership to 1JDogZS6tQcSxwfxhv6XKKjcyicYA4Feev
```

```
bt:ISSUE|0|JDOG|1000|1|0
This example issues a JDOG token with a max supply of 1000, and a maximum mint of 1 JDOG per mint
```

```
bt:ISSUE|0|JDOG|1000|1|0|BTNS Tokens Are Cool!
This example issues a JDOG token with a max supply of 1000, and a DESCRIPTION of 'BTNS Tokens are Cool!'
```

```
bt:ISSUE|0|BRRR|10000000000000000000|10000000000000|0|https://j-dog.net/json/JDOG.json|100
This example issues a BRRR token with a max supply of 1 Quandrillion supply and a maximum mint of 1 Trillion BRRR per mint, associates a JSON file with the token, and immediately mints 100 BRRR to the broadcasting address.
```

```
bt:ISSUE|0|TEST|100|1|0||1|1JDogZS6tQcSxwfxhv6XKKjcyicYA4Feev|1JDogZS6tQcSxwfxhv6XKKjcyicYA4Feev
This example issues a TEST token with a max supply of 100, and a maximum mint of 1 TEST per mint. This also mints 1 TEST token, and transfers ownership AND initial token supply to 1JDogZS6tQcSxwfxhv6XKKjcyicYA4Feev
```

## Rules
- `TICK` must be 1 to 250 characters in length
- `TICK` characters allowed are :
   - Any word character (alphanumeric characters and underscores)
   - Special characters: ~!@#$%^&*()_+\-={}[\]\\:<>.?/
   - Most printable emojis in U+1F300 to U+1F5FF
- `TICK` characters **NOT** allowed are :
   - pipe `|` (used as field separator)
   - semicolon `;` (used as command separator)
- `ISSUE` will be considered `invalid` if `counterparty` `ASSET` of same name exists
- `ISSUE` will be considered `invalid` if `counterparty` `SUBASSET` of same name exists, or is possible
- `ISSUE` may be considered `valid` if issuing address is the owner of the `counterparty` `ASSET` or `SUBASSET` of the same name
- First `TICK` `ISSUE` with `valid` status will be the owner of the `token`
- Additional `TICK` `ISSUE` transactions after first valid `TICK` `ISSUE`, will be considered invalid and ignored, unless broadcast from `token` owners address
- `DECIMALS` can not be changed after `token` supply is issued and/or minted
- `MAX_SUPPLY` max value is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (1 Sextillion)
- `MAX_SUPPLY` can not be set below existing supply
- `LOCK_MAX_SUPPLY` can not be set to `1` and permanently locked until `MIN_TOKEN_SUPPLY` supply exists.

## Notes
- `ISSUE` `TICK` with `MAX_SUPPLY` and `MINT_SUPPLY` set to any non `0` value, to mint supply until `MAX_SUPPLY` is reached (owner can mint beyond `MAX_MINT`)
- `ISSUE` `TICK` with `MAX_SUPPLY` and `MAX_MINT` set to any non `0` value, to enable user minting (fair minting)
- `ISSUE` `TICK` with `LOCK_MAX_SUPPLY` set to `1` to permanently lock `MAX_SUPPLY`
- `ISSUE` `TICK` with `LOCK_MAX_MINT` set to `1` to permanently lock `MAX_MINT`
- `ISSUE` `TICK` with `LOCK_MINT` set to `1` to permanently prevent use of the `MINT` command
- `ISSUE` `TICK` with `LOCK_RUG` set to `1` to permanently prevent use of the `RUG` command
- `ISSUE` `TICK` with `LOCK_SLEEP` set to `1` to permanently prevent use of the `SLEEP` command
- `ISSUE` `TICK` with `LOCK_CALLBACK` set to `1` to permanently lock `CALLBACK_BLOCK`, `CALLBACK_TICK`, and `CALLBACK_AMOUNT`
- `DESCRIPTION` can contain a URL to a an icon to use for this token (48x48 standard size)
- `DESCRIPTION` can contain a URL to a JSON file with additional information
- `DESCRIPTION` can NOT contain any pipe `|` or semi-colon `;` characters, as these are reserved
- `CALLBACK_BLOCK`, `CALLBACK_TICK`, and `CALLBACK_AMOUNT` can be edited via `ISSUE` action until `LOCK_CALLBACK` is set to `1`
- `DEPLOY` `ACTION` can be used for backwards-compatability with BRC20/SRC20 `DEPLOY`
- By default any address can interact with a BTNS token, to change this behavior use `ALLOW_LIST` and `BLOCK_LIST`
- If `TICK` contains any unicode characters, then `TICK` should be `base64` encoded
- `counterparty` `ASSET` and `SUBASSET` names are reserved within the BTNS for use by the `counterparty` owner
- `MINT_ADDRESS_MAX` can be used to limit the maximum `TICK` `AMOUNT` that a single address can `MINT`
- `MINT_START_BLOCK` and `MINT_STOP_BLOCK` can be used to determine period(s) when `MINT` transactions are allowed
